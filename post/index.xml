      <description>Sign Language Image Classification. I entered a simple Vision classification competition. This competition will be split into 3 parts. This is because we will keep improving on our model, but initially we start with a basic model.
 Introduction: Business Problem Description: The sign language database of hand gestures represents a multi-class problem with 20 classes of letters and numbers (excluding some classes which require motion).
Evaluation: The evaluation metric for this competition is accuracy.</description>

      <description>News Scraping Summarization Sentiment. I will be using 2 different types of transformers for this project. One for Summarization text and another Sentiment analysis.
 Introduction: Business Problem As someone new to the data science world, I find it hard at time to keep track of the various cutting edge technologies within our ever growing field.
A great way to keep track of the technology is to read articles on medium.</description>

      <description>Determine Braid type. For deep learning models we will be using the Drivetrain approach in model creation.
The Drivetrain Approach   Define objective : what are you trying to achieve
 classify 4 types of hairstyles:  cornrows bald fade not a hairstyle      Levers : what inputs can we control
 images from duckduckgo    Data : what data can we collect</description>

The Drivetrain Approach   Define objective : what are you trying to achieve
 classify 3 types of braids:  cornrows dreadlocks two strand twist      Levers : what inputs can we control
 images from duckduckgo    Data : what data can we collect
 augment the images after collection make sure images are labelled    Models : how the levers influence the objective</description>

      <description>Determine the best Classification model.** We do this by Using the following ML models and hypertunning the models:
 KNN   Find best K value create pipeline and cross validated Fit the model with a range of K values Model prediction  Logistic Regression   create pipeline and cross validated Model prediction  SVM   Find initial SVC Then grid search prams(Find best parameters) Pipeline cross validated Fit model with a range of parameters Model Prediction  Random Forests   Grid search prams(Find best parameters) Pipeline cross validated Fit model with a range of parameters Model Prediction    Link to App</description>

      <description>Determine the salary of a developer. We do this by exploring the following:
  Since we want to make a salary prediction, we will try two models, Linear Regression model and a lasso regression model
  Since our data contains 4 no numerical columns, we use OneHotEncoder function from sklean libriary
 OneHotEncoder converts categorical columns to nemerical columns by getting their dummpy values. I choose OneHotEncoder over get dummies because it can easily be added to my pipeline    Next we use a train test split to separate our data into the test set and the training set</description>

      <description>Determine a new location for a movie theatre in New York City. We do this by exploring the following:
 Richest borough Population data of New York City Busy entertainment area Fewest number of theatres in the borough (ie low competition) Of the five Boroughs in New York, which is the richest(highest income)    Link to Github Repository
