My Data Science Portfolio site

I was born in Bulawayo - Zimbabwe in 1996. I studied for a B.Sc degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Cyprus International University and graduated in 2019.

As I was in University, I became fascinated by automation and I began to taking programing courses. Through these courses I discovered the world of Data Science.

I completed the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from coursera, which helped me further my Data Science journey. I am currently building projects and exploring deep learning using the [Fastai library](https://www.fast.ai/).
